    state:
        The public API state that owns the SSE queues. The object must expose

    event_type:
        Fully qualified event type (e.g. ``"llm/starting"``).
    data:
        Additional event payload. A ``run_id`` attribute is automatically
        included so consumers can always correlate the event without reading
        the envelope.
